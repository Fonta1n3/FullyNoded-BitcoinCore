# Backups & Recovery - Best Practices

- Test your backup by actually deleting and recovering a wallet!
- Always store signers offline in plain text in a safe, preferably in multiple secure locations.

***TEST YOUR BACKUPS***

## Signers

***Signers must be backed up offline on a piece of paper or metal***

To make a wallet spendable you can either recover via QR code or wallet file
and then simply add the appropriate signer to the app by navigating to `Signers` >
`+` and inputting the words one at a time or pasting all of them in one go. Pay special attention to whether you added a passphrase to that seed in order for the wallet to actually sign transactions.
