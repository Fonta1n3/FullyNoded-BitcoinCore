When creating a single signature wallet Fully Noded will always display 12 BIP39 seed words you should **write down** and store safely. You may at anytime recover the wallet by simply adding them as a signer to the app. If you are completely recovering the wallet from scratch you can create a "Recovery Wallet" using those BIP39 words.

There are many sources to learn and practise smart custodianship for your seed words, for example:
